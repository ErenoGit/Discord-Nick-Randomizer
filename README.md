## Usage
1. In the "API token" field you need to enter your API token (currently it is not easy to get this token, use a search engine to find information on how to do it).
2. After entering your API token click "Apply API Token". This will fill up a list of your Discord servers that you have joined and where you have permission to change your nickname.
3. Click on one of the servers in the list to select it.
4. Enter a list of nicknames in the "List of nicknames" field.
5. If you want the nicknames to change one by one, in the order you entered them in the list, check the "Set nicks in specified sequence" checkbox.
6. If you want, change the value in the "Number of seconds how often to change nickname" field.
7. Click "Start!"! Done.
(Optionally) You can minimize the application and it will enter the tray.


WARNING: Discord has restrictions on changing nicknames, too frequent changes will result in a temporary nickname change lock (about one minute).
